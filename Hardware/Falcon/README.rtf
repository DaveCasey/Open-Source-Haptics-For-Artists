\f0\fs24 \cf0 Although the Falcon is not an open-source hardware device, it has been hacked. Thanks to Kyle Machulis for taking the lead on writing the driver for it! The driver source is included here for those who wish to compile it. However, a compiled version of the Max/MSP 5 external for OS X (Intel) "np_nifalcon.mxo" has been installed into the Software:MaxMSP:palette directory and might work for you.\
\
A very good list of references on the Falcon hardware can be found here:\

This reference looks particularly good:\
