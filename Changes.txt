Since the most recent release for the SMC conference paper 2012, I have made the following changes

 - cleaned up the code and made it more presentable
 - made sure that all of the 1-channel versions of the code were compatible
 - made sure that all of the 1-channel versions of the code were compatible
 - made measurements with an oscilloscope, which I used to note in the firmware how long each section of code takes to run
 - started to organize the Falcon code into the tree
 - provided Faust architecture file for using Faust to program the FireFader
 - also added the code to the git repository
 - inserted some figures into the tree to serve as documentation

Best,
