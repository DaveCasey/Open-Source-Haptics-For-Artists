PD IS NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED !!!!!


The pure data patches are not currently maintained for these reasons:
 ¥ The Max/MSP scheduler is able to run a little bit faster than the Pd scheduler, so the feedback control works a little bit better.
 ¥ It's harder to build physical models directly in pd because pd requires you to manually insert all of the single sample delays separately (so the patches don't look as nice).
 ¥ We don't have a particularly nice collection of models that are in good shape to be presented.

If you really need to use pd, drop us a line and we will see what can be done about it!

PS. In pd, try adding the following to the startup flags to decrease the delay for haptics:
-rt -sleepgrain 1
(or maybe -rt -sleepgrain 2 if the previous crashes pd on your machine)
