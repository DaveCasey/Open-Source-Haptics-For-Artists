Max/MSP support is implemented via the HSP ("Haptic Signal Processing") package

For Max/MSP 5.

It has been tested on Mac OS X with Intel processors.  Probably it would work on Windows as well (but to use the NovInt Falcon device, someone would need to recompile the external object "np_nifalcon.mxo").



VERY IMPORTANT
--------------
1. Add the "palette" folder to the paths for Max/MSP 5, and then try out the examples in the models folder.
2. Set the "Signal Vector Size" to 1 in the DSP Settings.
3. Set the "Event Interval (ms)" to 1 and the "Scheduler Interval (ms)" to 1 in the Preferences.
