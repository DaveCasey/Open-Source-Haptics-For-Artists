VERY IMPORTANT
--------------
A FireFader haptic device should already be attached to this computer for you to use.

For some examples, Max will need to use up almost all of the CPU power, so quit all other applications where possible.



Safety features
---------------
• The force is disabled if you push a fader all the way to one end.
• If you let go of the fader, the force to it is disabled.



To get it to work on your own Mac
---------------------------------
1. You will need to plug a FireFader in via USB.
2. Add the "palette" folder to the paths for Max, and then try out the Max patches in this folder.
2. Set the "Signal Vector Size" to 1 in the DSP Settings.
3. Set the "Event Interval (ms)" to 1 and the "Scheduler Interval (ms)" to 1 in the Preferences.
